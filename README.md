# FAC Fortunes and Cookies 

This week we used all our database and node wizardry to create a page where FAC20 submit their own quotes and wisdom, and receive a cookie containing the wisdom of others!

## If you want to install locally rather than using the heroku link 

- Git clone this repo
- Run `npm install` to set up node modules
- Initialise a local database
- Create .env file in project route
- Add `DATABASE_URL` variable in your .env file and assign to initialised database
- `npm run dev` will start the server 

### For our tests: 
- Run npm install --only=dev


## Our team 

- Amber : quality  🕵
- Shaya : design 👩‍🎨
- Terrence : deployment  🧙‍♂️
- Trish : facilitator  🧞‍♀️


## Our user stories 

- As a visually impaired user I would like to be able to navigate the page
- As a user, I want to submit my own and other people's pearls of wisdom and check-in question answers for the rest of FAC to read
- As a user, I want to come back later to read our responses as 'fortunes' 
- As a user, I want to know how to use the fortune cookie site and what it's for
- Stretch goal: As a FAC20 member, I want to search through the wisdom of my cohort for specific people's answers
